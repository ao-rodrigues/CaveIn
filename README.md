# Ores
A clone of the game Ores built from scratch using SDL2.

# Running the game
A pre-built version of the game can be found under `\Build`. Just run the executable `CaveIn.exe` inside that folder.

Note: the game requires having the Visual C++ x64 Redistributables and will throw an error on startup if they're not found.
In that case, here's a link:

# Building the game
This project was built in Windows using Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition. Just open the `Ores.sln` file and build the solution.
